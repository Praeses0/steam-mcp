# Steam MCP Server

A feature-rich [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that gives AI assistants full access to your Steam game library. Works on **Linux, macOS, and Windows**. 50+ local tools work from local files with **no API key needed**. 12 additional tools use the Steam Web API for online data like achievements, friends, and full library access.

Works with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or any MCP-compatible client.

## What can it do?

**Ask your AI assistant things like:**

- "What games do I have installed?"
- "Search for ck3" → finds Crusader Kings III via abbreviation matching
- "How much disk space is Steam using?" → full breakdown by game
- "Find orphaned data I can clean up" → identifies leftover compatdata/shadercache
- "What Proton version should I use for this game?"
- "Install Hollow Knight" → looks up the appid and tells Steam to install it
- "Pick a random game for me to play"
- "Show my full play history" → 13,000+ hours across 470+ games from localconfig
- "Import my Lutris games as Steam shortcuts"
- "Show my achievements for Hades" → unlock status, completion %, global stats
- "Who's online right now?" → friends list with online status and current games
- "What's on my wishlist?"
- "Show me reviews for Elden Ring"

### Key Highlights

- **Cross-platform** — Linux, macOS, and Windows (Proton tools are Linux-only)
- **No API key needed** for 50+ tools — reads directly from Steam's local files
- **Optional API key** unlocks 12 more tools for online data (achievements, friends, full library)
- **Smart search** — "ck3" finds "Crusader Kings III", "ror2" finds "Risk of Rain 2"
- **Full play history** — pulls playtime for every game you've ever played from localconfig.vdf, not just installed ones
- **Storage analysis** — shows exactly where disk space goes (installs + compatdata + shadercache + workshop)
- **Orphan detection** — finds GBs of leftover data from uninstalled games
- **Multi-library** — supports multiple Steam library folders including external drives
- **Graceful degradation** — unmounted drives are skipped, missing data handled cleanly
- **Custom VDF parsers** — both text and binary formats, no external VDF dependencies

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Steam installed in the default location:
  - **Linux**: `~/.local/share/Steam/`
  - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/`
  - **Windows**: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\`

> **Note:** Proton/Wine tools (compatibility tracking, prefix inspection, crash logs) are Linux-only. All other tools work cross-platform.

### Quick Start (npx)

No install needed — just configure your MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "steam": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@praeses/steam-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "STEAM_API_KEY": "optional-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> The `STEAM_API_KEY` is optional. All local tools work without it. Only the API-powered tools (achievements, friends, owned games, wishlist, profile) require it. Get your key at [steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).

### Configure with Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config:
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "steam": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@praeses/steam-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "STEAM_API_KEY": "your-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Configure with Claude Code

Add a `.mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "steam": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@praeses/steam-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "STEAM_API_KEY": "your-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Install from source
